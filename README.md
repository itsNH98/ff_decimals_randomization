# Effect of Decimals on methodologies employing Fama-French

**Note: Consider this as an ongoing project for future purposes. Not intended to be published in its actual state.**

## Abstract

Fama-French factors are ubiquitous in finance, mainly acting as controls in linear settings. Notably, their usage has been tantamount in asset pricing tests for alpha. We know from recent research that small deviations in these factors can impact the possible conclusions drawn from these tests (Akey & al, 2022). Using Chen and Zimmerman (2020) panel of clear predictors, we determine the impact of rounding errors induced by the decimals approximation implied in the construction of the Fama-French factors, on two types of asset pricing tests (Fama & French, 1992) (Fama & Macbeth, 1973). Conclusions to be determined...
